I’ve been in device heaven the last couple of weeks. With all of the new devices AT&T has released and finally having some time to play around with them, I’ve been having a blast.I've got 7 devices here on my desk and I'm playing with all of them.

### Windows Phone 7

I got a couple of Windows Phone 7 devices before Christmas and I’ve been using them the last week or two (I’ve even taken one of them as my primary device for the week). As I said in my post yesterday, I’ve found that Windows Phone 7 is a much better operating system than I expected. It’s clean, crisp and responsive – I actually like it. Not more than my BlackBerry, but I do like it. It would be very interesting to see what this looked like on a tablet.

### Galaxy Tablet

I got a Samsung Galaxy Tablet and I have to say that I truly love it. I know Steve Jobs is poopooing the smaller format, but it’s really, really compelling. The fact that Android is open and I can do essentially anything I want with it (as opposed to what Apple ‘allows’) makes it awesome. The form factor is great – it’s big enough to be really useful, but small enough to be very comfortable in your hand (as opposed to hands). As my wife said this morning “that’s something I could fit in my purse” and that particular though is really more compelling than you’d expect.

### Motorola Android Devices

I’m excited about using the Motoroloa Android 2.1 Bravo and Flipside devices. I really expected the Captivate to be the device I could carry full time, but it was so unresponsive most of the time that I just couldn’t use it. We’ll see what the Moto devices feel like.

### BlackBerry Playbook

I’m not getting the feeling that the BlackBerry Playbook is going to be a better experience than the Galaxy Tablet. The only thing it has going for it is the tight integration with the BlackBerry device. Since Research in Motion is supposedly planning on a Cellular version of the device (to be released later), I don’t see that feature remaining that compelling. Research in Motion supposedly sees people who don’t currently own a BlackBerry device being interested in the Playbook, but I don’t see it. I can’t imagine someone buying a playbook over the iPad or the Galaxy Tablet unless they are currently a BlackBerry user and want to stay that way. Any other reasons don’t make sense to me.
