I was up on Amazon this morning and I noticed the following review of my latest book ([Learning Progressive Web Apps](https://learningpwa.com)):

> Though the author is clearly passionate about PWAs, the writing is poorly edited and the explanations are incomplete. Examples are repeated and reprinted 2-3 times, as are instructions for running sample code.
> 
> Despite being a 200+ page book on PWAs, the author delegates the most crucial definitions and explanations to other resources. Precise information about how the API is structured is completely absent from the book — e.g., the service worker container is never even mentioned. Instead, you get unidiomatic examples and shallow explanations covering a fraction of the API. This book reads more like a series of blog posts written by a hobbyist than a programming text.

I know it's hard to get your ego out of the way of a bad book review, but in this case, I’m pretty sure the book review isn’t for my book. This isn’t the first time this has happened on Amazon, but in the past, Amazon would let me reply to the reviewer and set the record straight. On today’s Amazon, that option is no longer available.

So, looking at the review, the reviewer says the book is poorly edited and explanations are incomplete. That alone tells me this reviewer didn’t read the book since the book went through several thorough edits - there’s no typos, misspellings and all of the content is clear and concise.
