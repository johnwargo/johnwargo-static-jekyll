The View updated its web site today and I'm now listed as a Technical Advisor for the publication. I'm excited and looking forward to writing mobility-related articles for the publication and getting other mobile domino geeks like me to publish articles. Let me know if you have a topic in mind.

Here's a [link to the advisor listing](http://www.eview.com/eview/volr6.nsf/containerPage?openForm&target=advisoryboard-openPage#%20onClick;return:false;).
