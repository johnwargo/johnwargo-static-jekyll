I shutdown the web site for my Apache Cordova 4 Programming book today. The book published way back in 2015, and Apache Cordova has evolved a lot since then.

You can still buy the book on Amazon and other places, but there’s no longer the need for a promotional website for the publication. Don’t worry, the code from the book is still up on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnwargo/ac4p).
