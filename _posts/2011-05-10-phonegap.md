I started working with [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com) today. I've been poking around the framework for a while now and I finally got around to actually working with it. As with most Open Source projects, I find that the documentation is sorely lacking.

I'm building a PhoneGap application that uses the Domino RESTful web service I documented in a previous article on this site ([Mobilizing Domino Data Using REST: Part 1](index.php/domino/domino-rest.html)). I'll be using what I'm learning now in one of my sessions at the [View Domino Developer Conference](http://www.lotusdeveloper2011.com/). Stay tuned.
