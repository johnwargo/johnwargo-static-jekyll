I spent some more time trying to figure out if K2 was going to be a good choice for my cordovaprogramming.com web site. I had found a tutorial on how to customize views and it basically involved copying a bunch of template files then manually editing the php code to make my own views. Nope, not for me. What I’m expecting is the ability to create my own custom views and specify which fields appear where – just like the Drupal CCK does for me.

Like I said earlier, I’d submitted some forum questions and didn’t get much of a response. It sure looks to me like K2 is dead or near death. Too bad, it’s something that’s sorely needed for Joomla!
