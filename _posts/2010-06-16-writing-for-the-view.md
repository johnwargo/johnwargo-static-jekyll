I was excited when [The View](http://www.eview.com) asked me to be a technical advisor for the publication. As a long time Lotus Domino developer and more recently being heavily involved with mobile development, I am excited to have another forum where I can talk technical about both. I've written my first article and will soon be starting on another - look for the first article to be published soon (hopefully).
