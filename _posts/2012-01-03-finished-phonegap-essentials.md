I didn't get a chance to write a formal post about this, but on December 11th I finished the writing process of my forthcoming PhoneGap book called _PhoneGap Essentials_. I had a contract with the publisher that said I had to deliver the manuscript on February 2nd, but I delivered it about 6 weeks earlier â€“ whew! It was a lot of work and a lot of fun, I really like writing.

Right now the manuscript is going through a technical review; an experienced PhoneGap developer is reading through the manuscript, testing all the code and making comments back to me. I can't say who it is doing the review right now, but it's someone who really knows PhoneGap, so I'm excited to have him on the review team. So far he's delivered his comments on 19 of the book's 25 chapters, so hopefully he will be done soon.

I'm going to start working on processing his edits this week and hopefully have the book into the formal editing process some time next week. From there it will take a few weeks to get the editing all done then it's on to production then onto paper. Even though the [Amazon page for the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321814290/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mcnsof-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0321814290 "Amazon's PhoneGap Essentials Page") says the book will be available toward the end of May, I expect the book to be in stores by the end of March (or very quickly thereafter).

Don't forget that you can already pre-order copies of the book now. If you're interested in the book, please pre-order now. Right now, the book's not too high on the search results for Amazon, but as more people order a copy, it should come up in the rankings. Please help me out if you're so inclined.

Over the holidays I started working on the book's web site at [www.phonegapessentials.com](http://www.phonegapessentials.com "PhoneGap Essentials Web Site Link"). It's a little light on content right now, but as it gets closer to the book's release date, I'll finish up the articles and post some code samples up there. Check out the site if you get a chance.

Thanks in advance for your help and support.
