At the BlackBerry Developer Conference I picked up a tip that I thought would be very useful and I'd planned on writing about it but ran into a hitch...

I've always made great use of the alt-rbvs key combination you can use to view the source code for a web page in the browser. At the conference someone (I don't remember who) said you could use alt-rbdb to browse the JavaScript DOM for the web page open in the browser. As I tested it out and I found that it didn't work on my device. After asking a former colleague at RIM, I found out that that particular feature only works on RIM's internal Engineering devices.

Too bad, I was sure people would get great use out of this feature. Perhaps in the future RIM will implement it in all devices.Â  Please let me know if this works on any of your devices.
