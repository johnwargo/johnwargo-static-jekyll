Next week I’ll be attending SAP’s TechEd conference in Las Vegas. In previous years, I’ve attended the conference and spent most of my time visiting with customers on the show floor. This year I’ve been assigned several sessions (along with some colleagues), so I thought I’d let you know what I have going on this year.

First I’m doing a session entitled “MOB101: _Hybrid Mobile Application Development with Kapsel_” – it’s a one hour lecture session where I introduce Hybrid development with the SAP Mobile Platform. I’ll talk about what Kapsel is, what it does, how it works then show you how to build a Kapsel application start to finish. For Las Vegas, the session is offered twice:

*   Tuesday, October 21, 2014 from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM
*   Wednesday, October 22, 2014 from 3:15 PM to 4:15 PM

Next I’m helping Jeff Gebo deliver a two hour hands on session on hybrid development entitled “Mob160: _Build an HTML5 Hybrid App with Kapsel._” This session starts with a short introduction to the SMP Hybrid SDK (Kapsel) then jumps into the coding. First you’ll setup a SMP application definition for the session project then build a hybrid application that connects to SMP and utilizes the Kapsel Logon and OData plugins to onboard to the SMP server then consume an OData source while offline.  For Las Vegas, the session is offered twice:

*   Tuesday, October 21, 2014 from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM
*   Thursday, October 23, 2014 from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM

I’ll be joining colleague Senthil Krishnapillai in a session entitled “Increase Mobile App Adoption with Security that Enhances Usability” being held Tuesday, October 21 from 12:15 PM to 01:15 PM.

I’ll also be available for a networking session entitled “_Hybrid Development with SAP Mobile Platform_” which will be held Wednesday, October 22, 2014 from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM. The purpose of the session is to block off 30 minutes for attendees to meet with you to discuss topics related to the session title. In this case, I’ll be available to discuss questions around Hybrid development using SMP.

I have a second networking session with Senthil Krishnapillai entitled “_Use the SAP Fiori User Experience for Improved Connectivity and Security_” scheduled for Thursday, October 23, 2014 from 3:30 PM to 4:00 PM. In this session, we’ll cover how to enhance the security of SAP Fiori on mobile devices.

The remainder of my time, however much that will be, will be spent at the Fiori Café talking about [Fiori Mobile](http://scn.sap.com/community/mobile/blog/2014/10/13/update-on-fiori-mobile). Come by the Café to learn more about SAP Fiori, a lot of subject matter experts will be on hand to answer your questions.

I will have a few copies of my latest book on hand, so I’ll likely raffle them off in my sessions.  Who knows, perhaps you can leave with a copy.

I’ll also be at TechEd && d-code in Berlin; I’ll update you on that one after this TechEd closes.
