I've always been a little perplexed about everyone freaking out about Obama's BlackBerry. It always surprised me that everyone was writing articles about how he had to give up his BlackBerry because of security reasons.  Security reasons? It's the most secure mobile device in the market - how could there be security concerns? The headline of every single article I read referenced said security concern but didn’t really give the details. It just didn't make sense.  Let's think about it a bit.

The device is so freaking secure that it verifies the security signatures of the OS and the application platform when it starts up. No concern there, right? If a signature was invalid, the device would brick – not even complete the startup process. Even if someone could get their hands on the device, it wouldn’t work unless the person who mucked with it had access to the internal signing keys and algorithms that Research In Motion uses in its manufacturing process. I’m pretty sure it’s in Research In Motion’s business plan to protect them at all costs – any failure on this front and the BlackBerry device couldn’t be used by any government in the world and any security conscious company. Nope, no worries there.
