I'm knee deep in my book on BlackBerry development (BlackBerry Development Fundamentals - [www.bbdevfundamentals.com](http://www.bbdevfundamentals.com)) and I'm running into a rather annoying problem. The machine I'm doing most of my writing on is running Microsoft Vista 64-bit and while the BlackBerry device simulators run on Vista, they won't close when run on a 64-bit version of Vista. RIM is aware of the problem, but the Java development environment and the Visual Studio tools I'm working with both require that you close the simulator before you can go back in and edit the source code. Very annoying, I hope they fix that problem soon.
