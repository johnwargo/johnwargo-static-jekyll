A few months ago, the folks at the Raspberry Pi Foundation asked me to write a series of articles on Arduino development for a new magazine theyâ€™re creating. The magazine is called [HackSpace Magazine,](http://hsmag.cc) and the first issue is available (free) now.

My first article starts on page 82; its an introduction to coding for the Arduino platform.
