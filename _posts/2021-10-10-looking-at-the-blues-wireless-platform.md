I love working with microcontrollers; I got started early with the Arduino and Particle Platforms as well as Raspberry Pi (yes, I know, the Pi is not a microcontroller) and many others. I built a few projects on the Particle platform, but I never really got into the Internet of Things (IoT) space. Me hacking around with microcontrollers and single-board computers isn’t necessarily the IoT space.

I recently learned about Ray Ozzie’s latest project: Blues Wireless ([https://www.geekwire.com/2021/ray-ozzies-telecom-startup-blues-wireless-raises-22m-bill-gates-others/](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/ray-ozzies-telecom-startup-blues-wireless-raises-22m-bill-gates-others/)) and quickly ordered some hardware and got to work learning how to use it. IoT platforms are usually either a software only solution (running in the cloud) or a combined hardware and software solution. Blues Wireless is the latter. The purpose of this article is to give you my take on the platform, and I’ll likely publish additional articles here or elsewhere showing you how to use it for different types of projects.

Notecard and Notecarrier
------------------------

Blues’ primary hardware product is the Notecard, a tiny wireless device with a processor, some sensors, and an interface that allows other hardware devices to use it to send and receive data to and from the cloud.
