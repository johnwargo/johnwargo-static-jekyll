I've been using the BlackBerry Torch 9800 since it came out (one of the benefits of working for AT&T, you get new BlackBerry devices as soon as they come out). The first release was not ready for prime time, I had responsiveness issues and some pretty interesting ui weirdness. When the first maintenance release came out, most of the issues I'd encountered were resolved, and the Torch became an excellent device for me. I carry it as my primary device and have had very few issues with it.

Yesterday morning though, I went into my office to begin my work day and found that the Torch 9800 wasn't on.Â  I have it configured to turn itself off at 11 PM and back on again at 7 AM. It was after 8 and the device wasn't on. So, I poked and prodded it, but couldn't get it to come on. I had to pull the battery to get it to come on. Weird.

Later in the day, I was trying to do something with it and it became unresponsive and hard to use. At one point, I was trying to do something and it took a while to catch up with what I was trying to do and it left itself in the state shown the following figure - weird.
