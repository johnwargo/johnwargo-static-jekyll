title:  Lotus Notes Local Encryption Gotcha

I presented at a Domino Developer's conference in Boston a few weeks ago and provided a sample application that I used in my session. Unfortunately I forgot that in Notes 8 (might have started in Notes 7, I don't remember) local encryption is turned on by default.  I got an email from a participant last week telling me he couldn't access the database so I had to create a new copy without local encryption and send it to him and to the conference. How silly.

 I had to contact the conference people and get them a copy. If you attended the session and have the encrypted database on the conference CD, just contact the conference people or me (using the email address in the presentation) and you'll get a new copy.
