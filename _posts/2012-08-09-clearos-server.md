After I became a Novell ECNE and CNI, back in the 80’s or early 90’s, I promised myself that I wouldn’t have a network in my house.  Now, my office has a 24 port switch and 9 computer systems (including two Macintoshes) and I’ve networked two buildings here on the property. Oh how things have changed.

I’ve had a Windows server here for a very long time – it has 6TB of storage and I use it to backup all of my other systems (I backup my primary Macintosh computer to an AirPort in a different building). I also sync all of my iTunes music (a lot of it and ALL legal) to it, then stream it from the server to my [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com) box (I LOVE SONOS!!!) connected to my office stereo.

I recently upgraded the home stereo and have really enjoyed RadioIO, Pandora and other music services playing on the stereo. What I miss though is access to my music library. Sometimes you simply want to hear everything you have from a particular artist or listen to a particular CD, and the services my stereo can access don’t support that. I’m waiting for Sonos to add support for Spotify.

The new stereo can stream music from a media server, but my Windows Server 2008 box doesn’t include one and I couldn’t figure out how to add it to the server. I downloaded the Wild Media Server, but it wouldn’t let the receiver connect to it no matter what I did and the answer I got from the Wild folks was a recommendation that I not use their software. Crikey!

I was thinking of upgrading my server to the latest Microsoft Small Business Server, but instead was reading [Robert X. Cringely’s](http://www.cringely.com/belt-suspenders-cloud-storage-122387) column about cloud computing and the [ClearOS](http://www.clearcenter.com/Software/clearos-overview.html)[.](http://www.clearcenter.com/Software/clearos-overview.html.) I thought I’d install that OS on one of my boxes and see if I can use it as a replacement for my Windows server.

Right now I only have Sonos boxes in my workshop and my office. If I can get the media server working, I can finally listen to all of my music in the house. Wish me luck!
