The website for my BlackBerry Development Fundamentals ([www.blackberrydevelopmentfundamentals.com](http://www.blackberrydevelopmentfundamentals.com)) was retired today. The book was published back in 2009 and focused on BlackBerry 6 (or was it 7? I can’t remember it’s been so long) development. At the time, BlackBerry apps were written in Java, but now, with BlackBerry 10, BlackBerry devices run a completely different OS and apps are written in C. BlackBerry’s newest device is an Android device, so BlackBerry as a development platform is essentially dead.

If you have a copy of the book and you’re working through some code for a very old BlackBerry device, you can find all of the sample code from the book on my GitHub page at [https://github.com/johnwargo/blackberry-development-fundamentals-code](https://github.com/johnwargo/blackberry-development-fundamentals-code).
