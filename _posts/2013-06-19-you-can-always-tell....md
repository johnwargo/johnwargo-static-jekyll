You can always tell when I'm busy with something by how long it's been since I've updated the blog. I've got this big list of articles to write, but just can't seem to get to them.

At work, I've joined the Product Management Team for the SAP Mobile Platform, so that's keeping me very busy. I can't talk about what I'm working on yet, but I'll do some writing about it soon.

I learned recently that my PhoneGap Essentials book is the leading book on the topic (as far as sales numbers indicate). That's great to know and prompted my publisher to ask me about doing an update. We decided to do an update to the tools part of the book and I'm about a third of the way through writing the manuscript. I'll let you know more about the update as soon as I have the title finalized, a cover and its available for pre-order on amazon.
