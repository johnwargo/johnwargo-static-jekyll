Periodically I spend some time cleaning out some old books from my technical book shelf (I never throw out fiction and non-fiction books) that I no longer use. As I moved some books around on the shelf, I noticed some very old (late 80's, early 90's) MS-DOS books on the shelf. Think it's finally time to get rid of them?Â  I haven't done any DOS machine programming since 1995 probably.
