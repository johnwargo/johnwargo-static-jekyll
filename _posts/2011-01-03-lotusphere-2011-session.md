My Lotusphere 2011 session with Rob Wunderlich is BP209 and entitled [_Delivering Domino to Mobile Devices: More Stupid Tricks_](https://www-950.ibm.com/events/wwe/lotus/lsph2011.nsf/sessionabstract?openform&sessionid=BP209). The session is scheduled for Tuesday, February 1, 2011 at 1:30 PM. 

Last year they scheduled a repeat session, I guess that won't be the case for this year.  Come see us and say hello!
