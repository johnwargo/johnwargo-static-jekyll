Attached is the presentation that [Rob Wunderlich](http://www.dominounplugged.com) and I presented at [Lotusphere 2011](http://www.lotusphere.com). The session was entitled _BP209 Delivering IBM Lotus Domino Data to Mobile Devices: More Stupid Tricks_ and in it, Rob and I revisited our Ten Tricks for Mobilizing Domino from Lotusphere 2010. For this year's session, we took a look at last year's tricks and identified which ones didn't matter so much anymore (since the market changed the way it looked at the requirements) and tried to come up with some new ones.

The attachment is below, the following image is just a screen shot of the first page of our presentation.

One of the things I did in the session was demonstrate some applications. I showed how to use Apple's Dashcode development environment (Dashcode is a code generator for Safari web applications) to build an application that talked to a Domino data source. I tried to build the application in less than a minute but was only able to do it in a minute and two seconds. Drat. It was still fun to do - I quickly built the app then went back and showed what I did. The complete walkthrough has been submitted as an article to the [View](http://www.eview.com) and should be published in the next couple of months.

I also demonstrated how to build a BlackBerry WebWorks (Widget) application that connected to the same Domino data source I've used on this site for many examples.The complete walkthrough of this application has been submitted as an article for the View and should also be published in the next couple of months.

Having participated in the beta of the [Kryos](http://www.kryos.com) Velocity Designer for Lotus Domino (now renamed Velocity AppXcellerator for Lotus Domino) I was able to show how to use the Kryos platform to mobilize a Domino database.

In all it was a lot of fun and I hope I can do it again next year.
