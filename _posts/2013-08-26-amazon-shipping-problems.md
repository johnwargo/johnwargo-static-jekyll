I wrote a few weeks back about some shipping problems Amazon seems to be having. It's gotten worse, I recently ordered a CD from No-Man, a side project of Steven Wilson. I received the disc last week, but Amazon thinks they're getting ready to ship it any minute now as shown in the figure below:

I'm not sure what to do. Do I cancel the order? No, can't do that as it would be unethical. Do I let them ship it to me again? No, that would be wasteful and, if I try to refuse it or return it, they'll probably credit me back again. Ugh.

I could try to contact them, to tell them it's shown as not shipping yet but I already have the item, but they're online help isn't setup for that scenario.

I'm going to have to submit a support ticket, but why is it my responsibility?
