As part of my role as a technical advisor to [the View](http://www.eview.com) I decided a long time ago to start writing a series of articles demonstrating all of the different possible ways to mobilize a Notes or Domino application. I had a bunch of ideas and a bunch of different tools I wanted to play with, so I got to work. The cool thing about this was that I wanted to learn these tools, but had so many other things going that I just couldn’t find the time to do it. Fortunately, writing a magazine article about a particular piece of technology is a great way to motivate someone like me to learn the technology.

One of the products I’ve always been interested in learning is Rhodes and RhoConnect, two products from [Rhomobile](http://www.rhomobile.com) (now part of Motorola Solutions, the other Motorola Company, the one that didn’t get purchased by Google). I first learned about them while working at RIM and while something that interested me, I never found the time to work with it. I’d poked and prodded at it every so often, but I just couldn’t get my hands around what it was, how it worked and so on. I finally found a book on the subject and on a trip back from the West Coast I read through it and decided I could make it work.

Fortunately when previous employer shortened my two week notice and my current employer wasn’t ready for me yet, I created a simple Notes application they set about building the Rhodes application that connected to the database using RhoConnect. It was a challenge, but I got it all working and penned a series of articles on the topic. They’re all submitted to The View and hopefully should be published soon.

The folks at Rhomobile helped me out a bunch – there was some weirdness surrounding some information the Domino server needed to return to RhoConnect after creating a record. It all made sense, but I had difficulty understanding if it was working or not. Of course, I had a stupid coding error that I’d missed, but once that was gone I got it working, but didn’t know that it was. It’s a long story, you’ll have to read the articles to hear it.
