Since joining Microsoft, I’ve picked up speaking slots at several fall conferences. This weekend I’ll be presenting at NCDevCon 2017 ([http://ncdevcon.com/](http://ncdevcon.com/)), a community event held in Raleigh. I attended the previous two years and really enjoyed this conference. This year, I proposed a session, but wasn’t selected. One of my Microsoft colleagues changed positions recently and dropped from his session, so the event organizers asked me to pick up his slot.

I’ll be covering _Cross Platform Mobile Development Using Open Source Tools_, so I’ll present content on Apache Cordova and Ionic. I’m also going to cover JavaScript-driven native development in my session, so I’ll be making apps using NativeScript and React Native, It’ll be fun.

I’ll publish a link to the presentation and sample source code after the event.
