Over the years, I wrote posts here analyzing email content for suitability for reading on mobile devices ([http://www.johnwargo.com/index.php/mobile/email-message-layout-revisited.html](index.php/mobile/email-message-layout-revisited.html), [http://www.johnwargo.com/index.php/mobile/more-on-email-message-format-for-mobile-devices.html](index.php/mobile/more-on-email-message-format-for-mobile-devices.html), [http://www.johnwargo.com/index.php/mobile/ignoring-mobile-email-clients.html](index.php/mobile/ignoring-mobile-email-clients.html) ). When I started the blog, I was carrying a BlackBerry device and Android and iOS usage was on the rise, so I could give marketers credit for not thinking about mobile users as most email was still read on desktop PCs and laptops. Fast forward 100 years (well, OK, 4-8 years or so) and for many companies, not much has changed.

I use a desktop PC – mostly because I’m a developer and it’s much easier to code on a full keyboard with an enormous monitor. But, market trends show that desktop and laptop sales are down; that people are using their smartphones and probably a tablet for their day to day computing stuff. Even I’m using my tablet for email browsing in the evenings. So, what’s the deal with marketing companies and their email blasts?  
Take a look at the following images, each of them are screenshots from my Nexus 5X which has a pretty potent resolution. Each of them is an HTML-format email specifically designed for larger screens (like a tablet, laptop or desktop PC). I have reasonable expectations, I don’t expect much content to be above the fold in these emails, I expect to have to scroll or swipe down once my interest is piqued. I do, however, expect them to render correctly horizontally so that I can read the content without having to also swipe the page left and right to read everything.

We know that HTML and CSS are capable of delivering content to these devices in a responsive way, rendering the content cleanly on smaller devices – we’ve all done that to our web sites, right? Why are marketing folks ignoring email clients as well? They have to know that the content will likely be read first on a mobile device, then, if the user wants to know more, they’ll click and visit the web site (which is mobile-friendly) for more details. Designers and marketers have to start thinking about the primary way this content will likely be read and adjust their designs to accommodate. I care about these emails, I did after all sign up to receive them, but if they’re not compatible with smartphone screens I’m simply not going to read them.

I'll add additional images to this gallery as I uncover more poorly formatted email messages.
