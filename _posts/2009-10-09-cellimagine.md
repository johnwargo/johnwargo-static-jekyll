I had a conversation this morning with someone I met a while ago who also ended up being a friend of a friend of my brother's (it's a long story). Anyway, he's created a mobile device paging application called [TruePage](http://www.cellimagine.com) that looks pretty cool. I saw a demo of it a while ago. Check it out if you're looking for a paging application for BlackBerry and Windows Mobile. I hear other platforms may be in the works as well.
