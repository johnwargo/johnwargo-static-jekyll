I've been doing a lot of reading lately about Joomla! and I've been tweaking this site (and the [BlackBerry Development Fundamentals](http://www.bbdevfundamentals.com) site as well). I haven't been getting very good traction with the search engines, so I installed a Search Engine Friendly module tonight. Everything seems to be working OK, but I still need to learn some things about this system. The issue for you is that any links you've bookmarked into the site may no longer work (I'm not sure). You'll need to grab new ones (until I can firgure out how to setup aliases).
