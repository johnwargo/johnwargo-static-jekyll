I had an idea for a new web property (I'm not saying what yet) and thought it would be something cool to create using a different Content Management System(CMS) than Joomla (the CMS I'm using for all of my other sites). I selected Drupal because it was another CMS [FatCow](http://www.fatcow.com "FatCow") installed for free but also because of what many people have said about it online. It's interesting; Drupal is more configurable and more flexible than Joomla - more targeted at developers. It has less modules, but much much more flexibility in how it's configured and how data renders. I'll start working more on the site in a few months and we'll see what happens.
