I had to whack the comments component from the site this morning. I was using a Joomla extension I was never really happy with and I'd been having some problems with the component for some time now. I uninstalled it and installed a different one, so comments are now back up and running. I'll monitor this one for a while and see how well it works.

Unfortunately for those who'd posted comments previously, they are no longer available. I'm sorry. I still have the content, so perhaps I'll be able to show them or import them into the new commenting system.

Postscript:

I looked back and there were 70 comments posted to the site (using the previous comments tool) over the last 2 years or so. I feel bad about removing them from the site, but I'm not sure what to do with them. I can display them all by themselves in a view, but then you'd lose context by reading them. Many of them were useful comments about particular articles or kudos for a particular solution I wrote about here. I think I'm going to have to just delete them and get on with my life. Sorry again to those of you who'd posted comments.
