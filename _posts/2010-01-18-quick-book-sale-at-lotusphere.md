I was at the Lotusphere book store looking at some books I was thinking of buying when I noticed a young lady taking a look at my book - just to be funny, I told her if she bought it, I'd sign it.Â  I showed her my name badge and she got excited and purchased it on the spot so I could sign it. One easy sale!
