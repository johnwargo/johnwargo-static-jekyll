Broke the screen on my BlackBerry Bold 9000 Smartphone yesterday. While switching to an 8830 I had in a drawer, I encountered a 507 error while switching from one device to another. After much trial and error, I discovered that I had to pull the battery, connect the device to the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and reload the device software. the problem was that it would get so far and give me a 507 error again. What I ultimately had to do is start the process again and put the battery in right when it finishes the software load and resets the device.

You can't have a battery in to reload from scratch, but you do have to have a battery in to restart after the load. It would have been nice if Desktop Manager had warned me. That would have saved me about 30 minutes of trial and error.
