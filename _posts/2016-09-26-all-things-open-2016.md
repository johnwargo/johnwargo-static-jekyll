I recently accepted an invitation to speak at the All Things Open conference in Raleigh on October 26 and 27. I presented at the conference last year and I really enjoyed the event; lots of interesting topics, lots of interesting people. I delivered a session on Apache Cordova and got to spend some time with other Cordova enthusiasts like my colleague Carlos Santana (NOT the guitarist you’re thinking of).

This year, I’m still talking about Apache Cordova, but I’m also going to spend some time talking about JavaScript-driven Native frameworks like NativeScript and React native plus Microsoft’s Xamarin platform. Here’s my abstract for this year’s talk:

"There’s a lot of ways to deliver mobile apps: native, web, commercial mobile app development platforms, and more. In between those options are popular open source projects that provide robust, alternative approaches. In this session, you’ll learn about the venerable Apache Cordova project, the project that defined the hybrid mobile development approach, plus new upstarts like Telerik’s NativeScript, Facebook’s React Native and Microsoft’s Xamarin that take hybrid to the next level, giving developers the ability to create compelling, performant native apps using JavaScript or other languages. Expect a fast-paced, high-energy session with lots of content as John Wargo introduces you to a different way to do mobile using open source tools."

I look forward to seeing you there!
