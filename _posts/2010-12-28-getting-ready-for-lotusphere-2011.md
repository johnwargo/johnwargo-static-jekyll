In preparation for Lotusphere 2011, I've been working on some demos for the session Rob Wunderlich and I will be giving at next year's conference. One of the things I want to be able to show is how to use Apple's Dashcode web application development tool to access Notes data plus how to build a BlackBerry Widget that does the same thing.

I spent some time over the last week or so poking and prodding at Dashcode and was able (finally) to get it working this morning. It's pretty easy to build an application that talks to a Notes database, but Dashcode does something to the URL you enter that breaks it when you actually try to deploy the application in the wild. I spent hours on it this morning and just couldn't figure it out. I tried all sorts of different things trying to get my data to show up in the application. It was only when I looked over on my Domino server that I noticed that there was an error on the console. A simple change and all of a sudden it worked.

To learn more, come to our session at Lotusphere!Â  Stay tuned for details.
