I start a new job on Monday. I've been out of full time work since the end of September, which has been a lot of fun, but its time to get back to work and have steady income and benefits again.

During my time off, I did some interesting things. I completed certification as an OutSystems platform Reactive developer. I tried to complete my CSSLP (Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional) certification but failed the exam; that was a tough blow, but at least I focused some energy on development security for a while, so that put me in a good place.

I did some consulting work for a company, designed and helped build a cloud-based sales automation tool. This gave me an excellent opportunity to learn Firebase Functions and Google Cloud SQL plus I worked on my largest ever Ionic project which really solidified my skills there.
