I had a chance to attend PhoneGap Day in Portland this summer. Now that my day job involves Apache Cordova [http://scn.sap.com/blogs/johnwargo/2013/10/21/an-introduction-to-smp-kapsel](http://scn.sap.com/blogs/johnwargo/2013/10/21/an-introduction-to-smp-kapsel), I was able to make arrangements to attend. The event was a lot of fun and I learned a lot of interesting stuff about PhoneGap and what people were doing with it.

Here’s a picture of the goodie bag they gave all attendees. My favorite gift was the PhoneGap branded cell phone charger thingie. I love that and I was able to score a second bag and therefore get two of them.

There were some very interesting sessions. My favorite session was by Lyza Danger Gardner where she covered PhoneGap Self Defense for Web Devs. It was a fast-paced and very interesting session about the things that a PhoneGap (and Cordova or course) developer must keep in mind while developing web applications for the PhoneGap container. It all made perfect sense as I listened to her speak, but it happened so fast that I know I’m going to have to watch it again to make it sink in. This is an absolute must see for anyone building hybrid applications. You can find the video recording of her session at [http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/10/18/phonegap-self-defense/](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/10/18/phonegap-self-defense/).

There was another session that is worth noting; not because it was good, but for other reasons I shall try to explain.

Apparently the PhoneGap and Cordova development teams are beer drinkers. So, with much fanfare, they started serving beer beginning at lunch (and throughout the remainder of PhoneGap day). I like beer and I even like drinking beer (on special occasions of course) for breakfast and sometimes even lunch. In this case, I was in a room where a whole bunch of young people had started drinking beer at about 12:30.

Anyway, I made the mistake of saying something to someone standing next to me after lunch and he manhandled me into a conversation that I wasn’t very interested in but consumed a lot of time. Apparently this particular person had had a few beers and that only exacerbated his outgoing personality. Well, it turns out that he was a presenter and he soon went up on stage and delivered what was, in my opinion, the most inappropriate and unprofessional conference presentation I’ve ever seen (and I even saw John Cleese \[of Monty Python fame\] say ‘asshole’ during a keynote at an IBM conference). You can watch the video of his session here [http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/10/17/making-real/](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/10/17/making-real/). Please be forewarned that there’s a lot of obscenities in this session and the audio quality is not very good.

The slides for all of the sessions (except for Lyza’s, rats) are at [http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/08/02/a-look-back-at-pgday-us/](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/08/02/a-look-back-at-pgday-us/).
