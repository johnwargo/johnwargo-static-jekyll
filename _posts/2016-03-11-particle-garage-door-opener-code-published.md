I've been working on a project using the Particle Photon wireless device. It's a garage door controler that uses a Photon plus a smartphone app. I'm planning on writing an article about the project soon, I have to get this all installed and working first, but in the mean time, all the code is done, so I [posted it to my GitHub account](https://github.com/johnwargo/garage_door_controller_particle) yesterday. Stay tuned for the full article on how I built this thing and how it works. Here's the final product.
