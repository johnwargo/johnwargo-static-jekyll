Through my kids, I recently met another couple and quickly realized we had a lot in common. The bromance started when I mentioned a quote out of Monty Python, and my new friend Tim, I call him Tim the Enchanter for obvious reasons, quickly responded with another quote. My wife quickly rolled her eyes, but I knew I had definitely had a new friend.

Fast forward a few months and I was sitting in my bedroom reading a book when my wife grabbed me and dragged me to the front door. Apparently she ‘saw some movement outside’ and I had to ‘check it out’. Anyway, I grab a firearm (just kidding) fling open the door, and what do I find? This, full of gifts:

Tim and his family reproduced the Trojan rabbit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail and left it on my front porch filled with presents. Inside was a Ministry of Silly Walks wrist watch, a Monty Python coffee mug, and a Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh hat. What fun!

I wore the hat for Halloween, sitting on the front yard distributing candy. The mug? I use it all the time.

So I had to figure out what to do with the rabbit. I couldn’t throw it away, it’s too cool. I couldn’t store it a it would get ruined over time. The solution? Re-gift it. I figured that sometime in the future, I’d want to give Tim something, and I did. A few months later, I filled it with gifts and left it on his front porch for him to discover again.
