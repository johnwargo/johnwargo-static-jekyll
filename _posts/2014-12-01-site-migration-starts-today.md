I will be migrating this site to a new hosting account starting today. I don't know how long this process is going to take, so please be patient as I work through this.

I'm migrating the site for several reasons. It's been running on one of my personal hosting accounts and I want to move it to its own account/server for performance and security reasons. It's been running on Joomla 2.5 for a while and I want to get it to Joomla 3.x. Hackers have been having some fun with my site lately, so it's probably a good idea to clean everything up and start all over.

I'll let you know when it's done - for you, you shouldn't notice any difference (If I do this right). Stay tuned.
