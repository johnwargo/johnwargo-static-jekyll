I learned something interesting this evening regarding killing the BlackBerry Device Simulator on Windows Vista 64-bit. As I reported previously, you can't close the simulator on 64-bit Vista without resorting to the Task Manager. In writing the chapter of my book ([www.bbdevfundamentals.com](http://www.bbdevfundamentals.com)) on the BlackBerry JDE Plug-in for Eclipse I accidentally discovered that if you 'disconnect' Eclipse from the simulator (by clicking on the 'Disconnect' button in the Debug Perspective), it closes the simulator as expected. Â 

Nice, eh?
