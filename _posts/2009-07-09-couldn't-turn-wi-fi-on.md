As I was getting on a plane the other day, I noticed that the wi-fi radio was off on my BlackBerry Bold. I turned it on and the device immediately turned it off. I repeated the process several times and determined that something was wrong (I'm not going to say how many times I did it before making that determination). It was really weird and kinda funny.  Anyway, did the three fingure salute to reset the device and when it came back up, wi-fi would actually stay on when I enabled it.  Woohoo- problem solved.
