Whenever I publish a book with my publisher, they always pick one chapter and post it online for anyone to read. Picking the right chapter has always been a challenge for me because I want them to publish a chapter that’s interesting enough to make you want to buy the book while at the same time not being so good that you get everything you need and don’t buy the book.

Get it? Please buy my books. I write them because I like to write and think I have a special skill when it comes to describing technical topics, but at the end of the day I like the extra income. Buy my books, please?

Anyway, today, my publisher, Addison-Wesley/Pearson Education, published a chapter from my latest book. The book is called Apache Cordova API Cookbook, and they selected Chapter 1: An Introduction to Apache Cordova ([http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2235541](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2235541)).

The publisher usually consults with me on which chapter to publish – they typically ask me which one or ones I would suggest then go off and pick one then put it online. This time they simply picked one and went with it, so I didn’t have any say in what happened here.

As the book is all about the Cordova APIs, so they could either have picked one of the API chapters or picked the only generic chapter: chapter 1. The chapter introduces you to the concept of Apache Cordova, what it does, how it works and what it’s used for.  The book is targeted to mobile developers who have at least a little exposure to Apache Cordova, so this chapter is for those people who skipped the requirements and bought the book anyway – I had to give them a quick intro so they’d be able to understand the remainder of the book. It’s a good chapter and should give you a good teaser of what kind of stuff you’ll find in the rest of the book. If you like it, please buy the book. If you’re just getting started with Apache Cordova or Adobe PhoneGap development, you may want to take a look at the companion book: Apache Cordova 3 Programming (www.corodvaprogramming.com).
