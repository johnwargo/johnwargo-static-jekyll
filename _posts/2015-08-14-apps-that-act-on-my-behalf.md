The whole "There's an app for that" was fun for a while, but now it's time for us to be able to do things without needing an app. A good example of an early implementation of this is with Google Now where it automatically figures out that I've parked my car and gives me directions back to it. With no action on my part. Here's an example:

The phone new it was connected to my car as I was driving, it also knows where my home is and that I'm not at it. So it figures that I probably want to be able to get back to my car once I need to go home and simply takes care of that for me.

That's awesome, useful technology that requires no action on my part. That's smart computing if you ask me.
