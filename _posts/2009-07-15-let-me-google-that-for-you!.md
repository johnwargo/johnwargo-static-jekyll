One of my colleague's pointed me to this site a few months ago, for people who constantly ask you questions that could be easily answered on Google.  It's called [Let me Google that for you](http://lmgtfy.com/) and it can be used to create a link that when opened demonstrates how to do the specific search in Google.  Not subtle.

If you want to search on Twitter for example, you would grab the following url from the site: [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=twitter](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=twitter) and it would then show you how to do the search then display the results for you automatically. Too funny. I used it on my cousin Jennifer, she wasn't amused.
