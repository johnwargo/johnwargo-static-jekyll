In case any of you were wondering, in my day job I am a product manager for the SAP Mobile platform. I'm curently working on products that use or plugin to Apache Cordova. Earlier this week I recorded an SAP Code Talk with my colleague Ian Thain where I talk about Cordova and what SAP is doing with Cordova.

Right now I'm working on a product called Kapsel which is a set of SAP plugins for Apache Cordova and is part of the SAP Mobile platform. Kapsel essentially allows a developer to more easily build a Cordova application which consumes enterprise application services exposed by the SMP server. I'll be writing more and more about Kapsel on my SCN blog (see the sightings area of the site) over the next few months.
