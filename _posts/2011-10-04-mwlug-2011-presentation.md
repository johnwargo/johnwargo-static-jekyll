At the MWLUG conference in Milwaukee this year I presented a session on the Mobile Application Landscape for Domino. It was a fun (for me), whirlwind session where I talked about all sorts of things I have been thinking about related to mobile development and, of course, Domino. There were more talking points than real content in the deck, but several people asked me if I'd post the deck, so here it is. Enjoy!
