Did you see Google's [demonstration video of Google Goggles](http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles)? It's really amazing software that runs on the Android platform. It allows you to take a picture of something and retrieve search results based upon the picture. Check out the video when you get a chance, it's amazing.
