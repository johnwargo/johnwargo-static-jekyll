OK, I'm convinced. RIM's going to announce the BlackBerry BlackPad tomorrow. There were rumors of this last week, but you know how rumors are. What's sinching it for me is how coy my RIM contacts are. Tomorrow starts the BlackBerry Developer Conference, and it makes sense that if you're going to bring to market a new tablet device and run it on a new OS (as the rumors say) then you're probably going to make it available to developers (like me) first. I'm thinking, but I'm probably wrong, that I'm going to leave the event with one. Stay tuned.
