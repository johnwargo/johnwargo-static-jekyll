Surprisingly, the Amazon release of [Learning Progressive Web Apps](https://learningpwa.com) is delayed because of the Coronavirus. Apparently Amazon told publishers they’re only accepting shipments of essential items due to the Coronavirus, so it’s going to be a few weeks before any Amazon pre-orders ship. 

The good news though is that the ebook is already available on [InformIT](https://www.informit.com/store/learning-progressive-web-apps-9780136484226) and through [Safari Books Online](https://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/web-development/9780136485704). Print copies of the book will be in warehouse any day now, so you can purchase the print copy of the book from InformIT now and get the book in your hands in a few days. 

I presented at the Open Source 101 conference earlier this month and gave away 10 copies of the ebook. I’ve submitted several session abstracts for All Things Open, so I’m hoping I’ll be there distributing books as well. 

I’ve already heard from one reader who suggested some code changes to the PWA News NodeJS application.
