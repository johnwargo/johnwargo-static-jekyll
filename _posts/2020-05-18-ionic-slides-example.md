I love the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/), I know I’ve said that here before. I learned how to write Ionic Apps from Josh Morony’s [Building Mobile Apps with Ionic & Angular](https://www.joshmorony.com/building-mobile-apps-with-ionic-2) book. In the book, Josh provides an example of implementing an Ionic Slides page, an interactive UI where app users swipe between a set of images (an approach you see in a lot of apps today).

The book’s example made sense to me, but when I implemented it in my [Time Slicer](http://timeslicer.app) app I wanted to have some text at the top of each slide pages and the book didn’t show me how to do that - Josh added the text to his slideshow images, but I didn’t want to do that.

Anyway, I figured out how to do it and published a complete Ionic sample app that includes a complete example of the image-only approach plus my images with text on top approach. You can find the example on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnwargo/ionic-slides-example).

When you open the app, you see the screen shown in the following figure. Tap the first option to see an image-only example. The second has text on the pages. It’s pretty straightforward and the repo includes all the source and styling to get the look I got. I’m not a huge CSS guy, so I know there’s a lot more I could do to make it beautiful, I’ll leave that up to you.
