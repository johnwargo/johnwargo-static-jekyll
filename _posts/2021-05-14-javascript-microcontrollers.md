For many years now, I’ve worked extensively with a variety of microcontrollers and single-board computers. Since I was a small child, I always had an interest in electronics projects and the modern catalog of these computing devices gives me lots of opportunities to play and build things.

In my professional life, for most of the last few years I’ve coded primarily using JavaScript and web technologies. My work on the Apache Cordova project and associated books plus my day job for products in the Apache Cordova and mobile development space kept me mostly in JavaScript code (for hybrid application and JavaScript-driven native application work). Because of this, I’m always on the lookout for interesting JavaScript microcontrollers.
