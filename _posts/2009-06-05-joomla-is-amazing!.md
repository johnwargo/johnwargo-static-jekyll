[Joomla!](http://joomla.org) is absolutely amazing. I discovered this open source Content Management System a month or so ago when looking at the free tools my ISP ([FatCow](http://www.fatcow.com)) provides. I setup one site and very quickly had Joomla running almost every one of my sites (the only one that isn't Joomla yet is my [McNelly SoftWorks](http://www.mcnellysoftworks.com) site. I purchased a book on the tehnology (as soon as you try to add a menu item in Joomla you will know why I had to purchase a book to learn how to use this thing).

Anyway, the reason for this post is because every so often I take a few minutes and look for plug-ins to use to enhance the site. Yesterday, 20 minutes or so had me up and running on a code citation plug-in used on this site to highlight source code. This morning, I decided I needed a way to allow visitors to post articles to Facebook and other social networking sites. In about 15 minutes, I'd downloaded, installed and tested two different free extensions before selecting the one you see in the menu on the left.

There's thousands of extensions available and this site and others I manage are full of them. I'm using Joomla Extensions for code display, attachment management, guest books, Google and Amazon ads, Google Analytics, Captcha and more. The only one I'm looking for and can't seem to find (yet) is an extension that will let people sign up for notifications whever there's new content on the site. I posted a question about this on the Joomla Forums and nobody has responded yet. Maybe I'll write one.
