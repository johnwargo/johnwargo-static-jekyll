For years I've wondered about something and I've not been able to get an answer from any of my former colleagues at RIM. When you open the Alerts application and edit a profile, you'll see the highlighted entry as one of the options for defining and alert. You'll see all of your messages clients (Desktop for the BES email and up to 10 other email accounts through BIS) listed so you can specify settings for each email account but at the bottom of the list is always the one shown below: Web Client. What is this Web Client? I haven't been able to figure it out and a search didn't reveal anything. At Lotusphere this year, I asked everyone from RIM I saw there and got no answer. Â Help? What's it for?
