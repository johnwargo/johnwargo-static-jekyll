For those of you who are interested in BlackBerry Widgets (BlackBerry WebWorks) and how you can use them to talk to IBM Lotus Domino applications, [The View](http://www.eview.com) just published an article I wrote called [_BlackBerry Widgets â€” A Fast, Easy Way to Mobilize Your Domino Applications_](http://bit.ly/fEIGP3%20). In the article, I use the RESTful agent I illustrated on this site to build a BlackBerry Widget that talks to the Domino service. It was a fun app to write and I'm very proud of the article.

I wish I could share the information from the article here, but it belongs to the View. Check out the article if you're a subscriber. I'll be demonstrating the application (and how I built it) at the View Domino Developer Conference in Las Vegas in June.
