You may have noticed that I haven't posted much in a while. Lots going on in my professional life and I've been a bit busy.

I resigned from AT&T a few weeks back. I should't go into why I left, let's just say that it didn't end well.

I have accepted a postion at SAP. I'm in the Mobility Solutions Management group - which is SAP's name for customer-facing product management. I'm really excited to be working at SAP and to be back working for a software company again. In my new role, I've been assigned responsibility for Developer Experience - which means I'll have my hand in most any mobile development tools we create. As you can imagine, I'm pretty excited about this.

It's important to note that anything I post here, and I am going to have to make this a disclaimer on all posts from now on, reflect my personal opinion and in no way reflect the public statments or opinion of my employer.

Stay tuned, this is going to be fun.
