I don’t remember how I first learned about this service, but it’s pretty cool. Followupthen ([http://www.followupthen.com/](http://www.followupthen.com/)) is a free service you can use to remind yourself of stuff. What’s cool about it is that you configure reminder settings using the email address you send your message to.

First you have to sign-up for an account. Once you’ve completed that step, your remaining interaction with the service is all done via email. For example, to remind yourself to pick up a birthday present for your wife in two weeks, you simply send an email message to [2weeks@followupthen.com](mailto:2weeks@followupthen.com) containing an appropriate subject and optional message body. In two weeks, you’ll receive and email with the subject and body of your original email.

Pretty cool!

The service supports a wide range of options including minute, hour, day of the week reminders, you can setup recurring reminders and you can setup reminders for a specific date. You can even upload a logo to include in your reminder messages (useful for company use). Premium users can even add attachments to emails to have them sent back to them at the appropriate time.

You'll get an email confirmation that the system has recorded your request as shown in the figure below:

And, at the appointed time you'll receive another email with the actual reminder message:

Notice that it even allows you to 'snooze' your reminders.

Check it out when you get a chance.
