Apologies to anyone who tried to hit the site between last Friday and today. My ISP somehow switched my PHP configuration to PHP 4 and everything broke. I finally got it back up tonight and still have some issues to resolve with my ISP.

I'm working on the articles related to accessing a web service from a Java application, I should have the first article in the series up by the end of this week.
