With much fanfare, Microsoft launched Visual Studio App Center today.Â  This is the product team I work on at Microsoft.

Right now, App Center is the Visual Studio Team Services build service coupled with evolutionary versions of the Xamarin Test Cloud and HockeyApp. Today, App Center offers Build, Test, and Distribute in the cloud plus crash detection and analytics. You can sign up for a free account on App Center at [http://appcenter.ms](http://appcenter.ms).

If you watched the announcement, you may have noticed that we highlighted additional capabilities for App Center; things like Identity and Tables. Those capabilities aren't part of App Center today, but something that I'm working on going forward. My day job is helping to understand which additional capabilities do we expose through App Center. If you have any insights you'd like to share, please let me know.
