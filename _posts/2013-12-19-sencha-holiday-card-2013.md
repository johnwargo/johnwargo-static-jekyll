I just received a holiday card (via email of course) from Sencha. Check out the image below - how cool is that? Very Geeky.

I had a chance to do some development with Sencha this year and, once I figured out what I was doing, I really enjoyed it. I liked the ability to define a local store and let the Sencha Proxy manage getting the data back to my server. I owe all of you a big article showing how to build a server process that processes the Sencha Proxy requests, hopefully I'll get to that over the holidays.

Merry Christmas everyone. I'm not a fan of all that Politically Correcy Happy Holidays stuff.
