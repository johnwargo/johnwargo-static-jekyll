I'm working on the chapter of the book that deals with the BlackBerry JDE Plug-in for Eclipse (eJDE) and I had just completed imporing the Samples workspace (RIM doesn't ship it as an Eclipse workspace with the eJDE, so you have to import it manually into an existing workspace) and noticed something funny. In the comments for the HelloWorld sample application, the comments included:

The sentinal sample!

I think he or she meant 'seminal' but it stuck me as interesting that nobody ever things to grammar check comments in sample applications. Eclipse will spell check comments (which is sometimes annoying) but I never thought grammar checking was important until I saw that sample.

It had me LOL.
