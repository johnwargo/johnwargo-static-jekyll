I've been using [Joomla!](http://joomla.org) for some time now and I've gotten quite comfortable with it. Recently I've been helping August's cub scout pack, a neighbor and close friend build web sites using Joomla! and I've gotten pretty competent with it.

I branched out a bit and used Concrete 5 for my [johnwargobooks.com](http://www.johnwargobooks.com) site. It's pretty cool - it's more of a web based site builder than a true CMS like Joomla and Drupal.

I've setup domains for my new PhoneGap book, PhoneGap Essentials, and another site I wanted to build. For these two new sites, I've decided to build them using [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/). I'm excited to get started working on the sites; as soon as I finish writing the book (which should be by Christmas) I'll start working up the book's site and let you know when it's up there.

Stay tuned.
