Apache Cordova 3 Programming is currently available for order from [InformIT](http://www.informit.com/store/apache-cordova-3-programming-9780321957368).

Yesterday, Pearson Education released a sample chapter from Apache Cordova 3 Programming. You can access the chapter at [http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321957368/samplepages/0321957369.pdf![http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321957368/samplepages/0321957369.pdf](http://www.cordovaprogramming.com/components/com_sh404sef/images/external-black.png)](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321957368/samplepages/0321957369.pdf).

The chapter they used is Chapter 6 which covers the mechanics of Cordova development, describing in detail what the Cordova CLI does during the application management process as well as some very useful debugging and troubleshooting tips.
