Since joining SAP, I've been heavily involved in our partnerships with Adobe, Appcelerator and Sencha. I'm still trying to carve out some time to play with the new tools we've created in partnership with these vendors, but I've been too busy working on developer enablement activities. One of the things I'm working on right now is preparation for a streaming video presentation from the SAP Labs about these partnerships. I'll be on camera, ding interviews and other fun stuff.

If you get a chance, check out this session:
