Apache Cordova 3 Programming is **finally** available for pre-order. Apparently Amazon has issues with taking pre-orders for eBooks - people expect immediate gratification when they order eBooks, so Amazon won't list it until they have it. In the mean time, I was able to get my publisher to open up pre-orders on its web site, [www.InformIT.com](http://www.informit.com/store/apache-cordova-3-programming-9780321957368).

Order your copy now, they say it will be available before Christmas. A great gift for every geek you know!
