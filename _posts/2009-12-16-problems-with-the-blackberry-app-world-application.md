I've been having a problem with the BlackBerry App World application lately. I go looking for it and it's just not there. I keep re-installing it and it keeps going away. I started looking around on the forums and found a few posts on it.I'm going to follow the posts for a while to see if I can learning anything of interest.

I just reinstalled it and when I start the application, I get the following error:

![BlackBerry App World Error](images/stories/screenshot-dec1509-041837p.jpg "BlackBerry App World Error")

I just uninstalled and it's rebooting. We'll see if a clean install fixes this problem. Perhaps I was running a version for the 8900 that got moved over when I upgraded to the 9700 so maybe there was some weird incompatibility with the version I was running. We'll see what happens.
